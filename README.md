# trasher-cpp
Experimental, UNFINISHED, and inspired, support for TRS-80 Color Computer III Emulation in Godot

Much of this code was inspired or being refactored from a popular TRS-80 CoCo emulator's source code but unfortunately, at this time, I don't remember which.

# original README.md:

I left this project with working graphics modes.

-> Need to double check in video_graphics.cpp whether I'm executing the proper number of cpu cycles.

-> properly enable all interrupts to fire correctly in the video_graphics frame

-> optimize video_graphics frame by moving some variables to the class?

-> ocntinue on to implement sound, dac, joysticks, keyboard input
