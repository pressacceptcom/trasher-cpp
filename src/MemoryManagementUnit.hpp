/**
 * Memory Management Unit (MMU)
 *
 * XFFA0 - XFFAF, 6 bits (Write only)
 *
 * The 8-bit CPU in the Color Computer 3 can directly address only 64K bytes of memory with its 16
 * address lines (A0 - A15). The memory management unit (MMU) extends the address lines to 19 (A0 -
 * A18). This allows the computer to address up to 512K bytes of memory ($00000 - $7FFFF).
 *
 * The MMU consists of a multiplexer and a 16 x 6-bit of RAM array. Each of the 6-bit elements in
 * this RAM array is an MMU task register, and the task registers are used by the computer to
 * determine the proper 8K segment of memory to address. These registers are divided into 2 sets, 8
 * registers per set. The TR bit of FF91 (task register select bit) determines which set is
 * selected.
 *
 * The relationship between the data in the task register and the generated address is as follows:
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * | Bit           |  D5   D4   D3   D2   D1   D0 |

 * | Corresponding |                              |

 *                     |             |       ---------------
 *                     ---------------               o
 *                            o                      |
 *            SELECT          |          |\          |
 *            ---------------------------| >o---------
 *                                       |/
 *
 * When the CPU needs to access memory outside the standard I/O and control range (XFF00 - XFFFF),
 * CPU address lines A13 - A15 and the TR bit determine the address of the task register which the
 * MMU will access while SELECT is low. When the CPU writes data to the MMU, A0 - A3 determine the
 * address of the task register to be written to when SELECT goes high.
 *
 * The data from the MMU is then used as the upper 6 address lines (A13 - A18) for memory access,
 * according to the following:
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * |  TR | A15 A14 A13 | (Address range) | MMU location address |

 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It is important to note that, in order for the MMU to function, the COCO bit of FF90 must be
 * cleared, and the M/P bit of FF90 must be set. Prior to doing this, the desired addressing
 * information for each segment must be loaded into the designated set of task registers. For
 * example, if a standard 64K map is desired in the top of 512K RAM, with the TR bit set to 0, the
 * the following values should be pre-loaded into the MMUL
 *

 *
 * Chapter 3
 *
 * This chapter describes a new way of viewing memory and the much larger memory amount is accessed
 * and used. Such concepts as virtual and physical memory and memory mapping and pages are
 * described.
 *
 * NEW VIEW OF MEMORY
 *
 * Now that the amount of memory available in the CoCo 3 does not match the MPU addressing
 * capability, there are two classifications of memory. In the original CoCo the two classifications
 * were the same, but they are now disconnected from each other.
 *
 * Virtual/Physical Memory
 *
 *     Virtual memory is that memory which a program segment assumes to be available. This includes
 * that in which reside the program segment instructions and its local data area. The virtual memory
 * extent is limited by the MPU 16-bit address to 0-64K. The virtual memory may be RAM, ROM, or some
 * of both.
 *
 *     Physical memory is the total amount of usable memory in the computer. Not all of it may be in
 * use at the same time, but it is available. Physical memory includes RAM and ROM. The reduced
 * size, complexity, and cost of memory have resulted in the construction of computers with far more
 * physical memory than the MPU addressing extent can cover. A CoCo 3 with 128K of RAM also has an
 * internal 32K of ROM; this provides a 160K of physical memory. A 512K CoCo 3 has 544K of physical
 * memory.
 *
 * Memory Pages
 *
 *     The memory extent, either virtual or physical, is no longer considered as a seamless
 * continuum but rather as segmented into pages. A memory page is an 8K block (where each block is a
 * continuous range of addresses) of memory that starts on an 8K boundary. For example, addresses
 * 0-1FFF and A000-BFFF each constitute a valid memory page. Also, each page is identified by its
 * page number.
 *
 *     PAGE #    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *             |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 *  ADDRESS 0000   | 4000  | 8000  | C000  |   FFF
 *                 |       |       |       |
 *               2000    6000    A000    E000
 *
 * Fig. 3-1. Virtual Memory Pagination
 *
 *     The virtual memory extent is divided into eight 8K pages as shown in Fig. 3-1. They are
 * numbered 0-7. The page number that any particular address occupies is determined by the three
 * MSBs of that address. For example, DC23 is in page six as shown below.
 *
 * DC23   = 1101 1100 0010 0011
 *          ---
 *           |
 * Page # =  6
 *
 *     The 512K physical memory extent is divided into sixty-four 8K pages as shown in Fig. 3-2. The
 * pages are numbered 0-3F. The page number of any particular address is determined by the six MSBs
 * of that physical address. In the CoCo 3, physical memory is considered to start at the 512K
 * address point and extend downward toward zero. Therefore, in a 128K system, the physical memory
 * extent proceeds from the 512K point down to 384K. Thus, the physical memory pages available in a
 * 128K computer are 30-3F.
 *

 *
 * MANAGING MEMORY
 *
 *     Memory management is a new program responsibility; controlling the virtual and physical
 * memory pages. Its purpose is to associate the required virtual memory pages with the appropriate
 * physical memory pages. It is done by a program segment (the memory manager) that controls the
 * memory management unit.
 *
 * RAM Memory Mapping
 *
 *     Memory mapping is the process of associating virtual memory pages with physical pages. That
 * is, each virtual page is assigned, or pointed, to a particular physical page. It is in physical
 * memory that programs and data are stored. The virtual memory pages are like windows which allow
 * viewing or accessing items in physical memory. In a technical sense, the virtual address extent
 * is said ot be mapped onto the physical address extent. A mapping example of a 128K computer is
 * shown in Fig. 3-3. The memory mapping for a particular program may be static or changed as the
 * program proceeds.

 *
 * Memory Management Unit
 *
 *     The memory management unit (MMU) is a programmable hardware device that assigns virtual pages
 * to physical pages. Up to eight virtual pages (a 64K extent) may be assigned to a maximum of eight
 * physical pages (a 64K extent) at any one time.
 *
 *     The MMU is composed of two sets of eight page address registers (PARs) each and its control
 * logic. Each PAR is six bits (5-0) long. Each of the eight PARs (numbered 0-7) of either set
 * always corresponds with the eight virtual pages (0-7). The two sets of PARs, the executive set
 * and the task set, and their dedicated addresses are shown in Table 3-1. A virtual page is mapped
 * to a physical page by writing the physical page number into the dedicated address of that virtual
 * page's corresponding PAR. For example, virtual page 5 is mapped to physical page 2C by storing
 * 2C in FFAD (using the task set).
 *
 * -------------------------------------------
 * |   Executive Set    |      Task Set      |
 * -------------------------------------------
 * | PAR # | Ded. Addr. | PAR # | Ded. Addr. |
 * -------------------------------------------
 * |   0   |    FFA0    |   0   |    FFA8    |
 * |   1   |    FFA1    |   1   |    FFA9    |
 * |   2   |    FFA2    |   2   |    FFAA    |
 * |   3   |    FFA3    |   3   |    FFAB    |
 * |   4   |    FFA4    |   4   |    FFAC    |
 * |   5   |    FFA5    |   5   |    FFAD    |

 * |   7   |    FFA7    |   7   |    FFAF    |
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Table 3-1. PAR Sets
 *
 *     The MMU converts a virtual address to a physical address by generating a 19-bit address from
 * the 16-bit virtual address and the content of a PAR. The three MSBs of the virtual address select
 * one of the eight PARs whose content forms the six MSBs of the physical address. The lower
 * thirteen bits of the physical address are the same as those of the virtual address. Fig. 3-4
 * shows an MMU block diagram and the conversion process.

 * Fig. 3-4. MMU Operation
 *
 *     MMU operation is controlled by two bits in the ACVC control registers. Bit 0 of FF91 selects
 * either the executive (bit clear) or task (bit set) set of PARs for use in accessing physical RAM.
 * Normally a large program or a system of programs has a controller segment which calls the other
 * program segments as required. The CoCo 3 is designed for the controller segment to always be
 * mapped by the executive PAR set. The controller, before it is to call another program segment,
 * will map that segment with the task PAR set. Then it will switch to the task PAR set and call the
 * segment. This arrangement also calls for a small part of the task virtual memory extent to always
 * map part (the interface) of the controller. It is through the interface that MPU control is
 * either passed to the called segment or returned to the controller. Typically the kernel of an
 * operating system is the controller just described. The application or task programs (utilities
 * and user programs) are the called segments that run under the task PAR set.
 *
 *     Bit 6 of FF90 enables (bit set) or disables (bit clear) the operation of the MMU. When
 * enabled, the MMU operates as already described. When disabled, the MMU always sets the expanded
 * address bits Y18-Y16. This causes the 64K virtual extent to always be mapped onto the uppermost
 * 64K of physical memory.
 *
 *     The exception to the previously described MMU operation is when the virtual address is in the
 * range FF00-FFFF. These (the dedicated addresses) are not expanded and sent to RAM but are always
 * routed to their appropriate device and/or control register. Therefore, there are 8K minus 256 RAM
 * addresses in virtual page 7.
 *
 *     The 128K CoCo 3 has a physical memory addressing idiosyncracy. The content of physical memory
 * is present in all the groups of physical pages. it is present in its normal physical page group
 * of 30-3F, and the other page groups of 00-0F, 10-1F, and 20-2F. This is so because the two MSBs
 * of the expanded address (Y18 and Y17) are not used.
